### 문제 설명

<p>Making chocolate chip cookies involves mixing flour, salt, oil, baking soda and chocolate chips to form dough which is rolled into a plane. Circles are cut from the plane, placed on a cookie sheet, and baked in an oven for about twenty minutes. When the cookies are done, they are removed from the oven and allowed to cool before being eaten.</p>

<p>We are concerned here with the process of cutting a single round cookie that contains all the chocolate chips. Once the dough has been rolled, each chip is visible in the planar dough, so we need simply to find a cookie cutter big enough to circle all the chips. What is the diameter of the smallest possible round cookie containing all the chips?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a positive integer $n$ not greater than $10$, followed by $n$ lines of input. Each line gives the coordinates of one chocolate chip on the plane. Each coordinate is an integer in the range $[0, 1000]$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output consists of a single real number, the diameter of the cookie rounded to two decimal places.</p>
